## Roadmap

The goal of this project is to provide a small set of production-ready OpenRewrite recipes for deterministic HCL refactoring.

Planned improvements (incremental, based on real migration needs):

### Basic input value support

- Boolean values
- Numeric values

### Complex input value support

- List values
- Map values
